# Welcome to My First Repository!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bill Cortez, Iâ€™m excited to share my inaugural project on GitHub.
This repository serves as a place for me to share my work, learn, and grow as a developer. 
Iâ€™m excited to begin contributing to the open-source community and collaborating with others.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or reach out if you have any questions. Stay tuned for more projects coming soon!

Thanks for checking out my repository! ðŸ˜Š
